TCP/IPa
TCP/IPa is, well an IPA.  Not over the top like some many other IPAs out there, this IPa has all the bitter and flavor notes of a hoppy beer without being offensive.  Arrogant Bastards we are not.

Grains  |    Belgian Pilsner / Pale Malt / Crystal 60 <br>
Hops  |  Cascade / Citra <br>
Yeast  |  Wyeast 1056 American Ale

CYBEER

OMG CYBER is more than a meme, it's a way of life and an unfortunate job security tool.  It also makes a great beer. Crisp, clean, unfiltered, this wheat ale is almost as cool as that 5 line python code you wrote that breaks some DRM or something.  If we were beer hipsters, this would be our 'session' beer.

Grains:  Wheat <br>
Hops:    Just a Little <br>
Yeast:   Safale US-05
